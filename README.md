# algohut
A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Java/Scala. The purpose of this project is purely didactic.

## Data structures
* Trees
    * BinaryTree
    * BinarySearchTree
    
* Lists
    * Doubly Linked List
    * Singly Linked List

## Algorithms
* Binary Trees
    * Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of 2 nodes

* Linked Lists
    * compute merge point (intersection) of 2 singly linked lists.
    * merge two sorted lists in place. (O(n) time, O(1) space).
